# GAME-DEVELOPMENT

Welcome to this project

Here, I have used PYGAME module available in python .

It consists of:
1. A Game loop with increasing score on eating each food block(generated using random function) as well as updation of high score stored in a text file.
2. Game loop breaks when "gameover" due to:
      a) either collision with itself or
      b) collision with the boundary(out of bound condition)

Thanks for viewing!
